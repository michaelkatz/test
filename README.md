# Efficient Meta Subspace Optimization

This project includes the code accompanying the submission to AutoML 2022 entitled "Efficient Meta Subspace Optimization".

The code implements a meta optimizer which is applied to the subspace optimization paradigm, and used to optimize the 
loss function of Robust Linear Regression, described in section 4.2 of the paper:

The code runs three algorithms:

- SESOP: The Sequential Subspace Optimization (SESOP) algorithm described in:  
Narkiss, G. and Zibulevsky, M. (2005). Sequential subspace optimization method for large-scale
unconstrained problems. Technical Report CCIT 559, Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology, 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering.
- RB: A Rule based algorithm described in Section 3.3 of the paper
- MSO: The meta optimizer described in Algorithm 1 in the paper.
